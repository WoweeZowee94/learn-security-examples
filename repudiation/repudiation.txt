- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
The initial implementation is at risk of anonymous and untrackable user actions. Because there is no authentication or logging
of requests made to the server, anyone can access potentially sensitive information through pinging the endpoints and will not
be traceable when they do.
The secure version is better because it implements a logging middleware that tracks and logs all requests made to the server,
and it implies the implementation of authentication for sensitive endpoints such as the 'get-messages' endpoint.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
An authentication middleware that prevents potentially malicious users from accessing the primary components of the application,
preventing them from doing things like adding potentially malicious messages and pinging the messages endpoint without being
an authenticated user.
